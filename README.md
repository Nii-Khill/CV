<h1>CV Generator Application</h1>

This project is a fully functional CV/Resume Generator built with React. It allows users to create a complete, professional CV directly in the browser through a structured set of input sections and a live preview interface.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The application provides multiple sections for users to enter their information, including General Information, Education, and Practical Experience. Each section supports adding multiple entries. Users can also add multiple responsibilities under each job role and delete entries when necessary. Once the form is submitted, users may switch into edit mode to modify their information as needed.

The right side of the application displays a live, formatted CV preview that updates automatically based on user input. When the CV is complete, users can download it as a PDF.
